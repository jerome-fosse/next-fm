### User Directives

1. **Consent for Modifications**: The agent must NEVER modify files (creation, edition, deletion) without explicit consent from the user.
2. **Modification Process**:
    - Analyze the problem.
    - Propose the solution and code snippets in the conversation.
    - Wait for user validation (e.g., "Apply", "Looks good").
    - Once agreement is received, perform the technical modifications.
