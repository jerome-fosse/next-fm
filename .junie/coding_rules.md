### Coding Rules

1. **Simplicity and Readability**:
    - The simplest solutions are often the best.
    - Unless there are major contraindications (security flaws, critical performance impact ...), always prioritize code simplicity and readability.
    - `useEffect` should be used as a last resort. If an equivalent solution exists that does not use `useEffect`, it must be preferred.
